# Chapter 11: Learning by Doing
## Introduction:
- This chapter transitions from foundational concepts to practical assembly language programming
- Chapter focus is on:
    - Writing and editing programs in CP/M
    - Using tools like ED aka Editor, ASM aka Assembler, and LOAD
    - Learning through step-by-step programming exercises

## Purpose:
- Teach assembly language programming through a hands-on approach
- Enable understanding of:
    1. Writing code using ED editor
    2. Assembling programs into "executables"
    3. Debugging and running programs in CP/M
